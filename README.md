## Run

Download all data from RAE
```
python3 src/rae_downloader.py
```

It generates the file ```data/palabras_todas.txt```

Split in diferent files
```
bash src/spliter.sh
```

### Classify words by their length

The `0_palabras_todas.txt` file is needed.

Go to the `diccionario-espanol-txt/src` folder and running the `length.sh` file will create the `diccionario-espanol-txt/length` folder with the words classified by its length.

```
chmod +x length.sh
./length.sh
```

### Classify words by their first letter

The `0_palabras_todas.txt` file is needed.


Due to the lack of `palabras_todas.txt` file (creating it will last so many hours) the `spliter.sh` file will not work. So this script works with the `0_palabras_todas.txt` file.

Go to the `diccionario-espanol-txt/src` folder and running the `starting_letter.sh` file will create the `diccionario-espanol-txt/starting_letter` folder with the words classified by the first letter.

```
chmod +x starting_letter.sh
./starting_letter.sh
```
